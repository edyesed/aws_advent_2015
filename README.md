# aws_advent_2016

* We're going to make a collection of widgets that count words. It'll be triggered by an outgoing wehbook in Slack

* The API Gateway will call a Lambda Function that will split whatever text it is given into specific words
      * Upsert a key in a dynamodb table with the number 1
      * Drop a message on a SNS Topic
* The SNS Topic will have two lambdas attached to it that will
      * upsert the same keys in the dynamodb with the number 10
      * log a message to CloudWatchLogs

It looks like this picture here ![diagram here](img/AWS_Advent_Diagram.png "AWS Advent chat thing")

Example code for AWS Advent near-code-free pubsub. 
Technologies you'll use
* Slack  ( outgoing webhooks )
* API Gateway
* IAM
* SNS
* Lambda
* DynamoDB

# Pub/Sub is teh.best.evar* ( *for some values of best )
I came into the world of computing by way of *The Operations Path*.  The [Publish-Subscribe Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) has always been near and dear to my ‚ù§Ô∏è. 

There are a few things about pubsub that I really appreciate as an "infrastructure person". 

1. **Scalability**. In terms of the transport layer ( usually a message bus of some kind ), the ability to scale is separate from the publishers and the consumers. In this wonderful thing which is AWS, we as infrastructure admins can get out of this aspect of the business of running pubsub entirely.

1. **Loose Coupling**. In the happy path, publishers don't know anything about what subscribers are doing with the messages they publish.  There's admittedly a little hand-waving here, and folks new to pubsub (and sometimes those that are experienced ) get rude suprises as messages mutate over time.

1. **Asynchronous**. This is not necessarily inherent in the pubsub pattern, but it's the most common implementation that I've seen.  There's quite a lot of pressure that can be absent from Dev Teams, Operations Teams, or DevOps Teams when there is no expectation from the business that systems will retain single millisecond response times.

1. **New Cloud Ways**. Once upon a time, we needed to queue messages in pubsub systems ( and you might you might still have a need for that feature ), but with Lambda, we can also invoke consumers _on demand_ as messages pass through our system. We don't have necessarily keep things in the queue at all. Message appears, processing code runs, everybody's happy.

# Yo dawg, I heard you like Ô∏è‚òÅÔ∏è
One of the biggest benefits that we can enjoy from being hosted with AWS is *not having to manage stuff*.  Running your own message bus might be something that separates your business from your competition, but it might also be _undifferentiated heavy lifting_.  

IMO, if AWS can and will handle scaling issues for you ( to say nothing of only paying for the transactions that you use ), then it might be the right choice for you to let them take care of that for you.

I would also like to point out that running these things without servers isn't quite the same thing as running them simply.  I ended up redoing this implementation a few times as I kept finding the rough edges of running things serverless. All were ultimately addressable, but I wanted to keep the complexity of this down somewhat.


# WELCOME TO THE FUTURE, FRIENDS
`TL;DR` GIMMIE SOME EXAMPLES

CloudFormation is pretty well covered by [AWS Advent](http://awsadvent.tumblr.com), we'll configure this little diddy via the AWS console. 


# TO THE ~~BAT~~CODE CAVE! 
## Setup the first lambda, which will be linked to an outgoing webhook in slack
### Setup the DynamoDB 

üëá You can follow the steps below, or view  this video üëâ [![Video to DynamoDB Create](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ww3aSExgkRM/1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ww3aSExgkRM "Make a DynamoDB")

1. Console  
1. DynamoDB
1. Create Table
    1. Table Name `table`
    1. Primary Key `word`
    1. `Create`

### Setup the First Lambda 

This lambda accepts the input from a slack outgoing webhook, splits the input into separate words, and adds a count of one to each word. It further returns a json response body to the outgoing webhook that displays a message in slack. 

If the lambda is triggered with the input `awsadvent some words`, this lambda will create the following three keys in dynamodb, and give each the value of one.
     * **awsadvent** = **1**
     * **some** = **1**
     * **words** = **1**

# Ok. now we want to do the awesome pubsub stuff
### Make the SNS Topic
We're using a SNS Topic as a broker. The **producer** ( the `aws_advent` lambda ) publishes messages to the SNS Topic.  Two other lambdas will be **consumers** of the SNS Topic, and they'll get triggered as new messages come into the Topic.

üëá You can follow the steps below, or view  this video üëâ [![Video for setting up the SNS Topic](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZB2Y-fEIYJ0/1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZB2Y-fEIYJ0 "Setup the SNS Topic")
1. Console
1. SNS
1. New Topic
1. Name `awsadvent`
1. ***Note the topic ARN***
           

### Add additional permissions to the first lambda
This permission will allow the first lambda to talk to the SNS Topic. You also need to set an environment variable on the `aws_advent` lambda to have it be able to talk to the SNS Topic. 

üëá You can follow the steps below, or view  this video üëâ [![Adding additional IAM Permissions to the aws_lambda role](https://img.youtube.com/vi/b9cXoz6e8zA/1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/b9cXoz6e8zA "Setup the SNS Topic")
1. Give additional IAM permissions on the role for the first lambda
     1. Console
     1. IAM
     1. Roles `aws_advent_lambda_dynamo`
         1. Permissions
         1. Inline Policies
         1. click here
         1. Policy Name
         1. `aws_advent_lambda_dynamo_snspublish`

         ``` javascript
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[{
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":"sns:Publish",
      "Resource":"arn:aws:sns:*:*:awsadvent"
      }
   ]
}
         ```



### Add the SNS Topic Arn to the aws_advent lambda
üëá You can follow the steps below, or view  this video üëâ [![Adding a new environment variable to the lambda](https://img.youtube.com/vi/k_7KnVi9jy8/1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k_7KnVi9jy8 "Adding a new environment variable to the lambda")

There's a conditional in the `aws_advent` lambda that will publish to a SNS topic, if the SNS_TOPIC_ARN environment variable is set. Set it, and watch more pubsub magic happen.

1. Add the *SNS_TOPIC_ARN* environment variable to the `aws_advent` lambda
     1. Console
     1. LAMBDA
     1. `aws_advent`
     1. Scroll down
     1. `SNS_TOPIC_ARN`
         1. The SNS Topic ARN from above.

### Create a publisher lambda: `aws_advent_sns_multiplier`
This lambda will subscribe to the SNS Topic, and will get invoked whenever a message comes into the SNS Topic. 

This lambda reads the message sent to the SNS topic, and adds a count of ten to each word in the message.

üëá You can follow the steps below, or view  this video üëâ [![Creating the sns_multiplier lambda](https://img.youtube.com/vi/L4LeoxR5pV4/1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/L4LeoxR5pV4 "Creating the sns multiplier lambda")

1. Console
1. lambda
1. Create a Lambda function
1. Select Blueprint
        1. search sns
        1. `sns-message` python2.7 runtime
1. Configure Triggers
   1. SNS topic
        1. `awsadvent`
        1. click `enable trigger`
1. Name
    1. `sns_multiplier`
1. Runtime
    1. Python 2.7
1. Code Entry Type
    1. Inline
        1. It's included as [sns_multiplier.py](src/sns_multiplier/sns_multiplier.py) in this repo.

1. Role
    1. Create new role from template(s)
1. Policy Templates
   1. Simple Microservice permissions

### Go back to slack and test it out. 
Now that you have the most interesting parts hooked up together, test it out!

What we'd expect to happen is pictured here üëâ ![everything working](img/AWSADVENT_BOT_withsnsmultiplier.png "Everything working")

üëá Writeup is below, or view  this video üëâ [![Creating the sns_multiplier lambda](https://img.youtube.com/vi/e41IDKFO8dI/1.jpg)](https://youtu.be/e41IDKFO8dI "Creating the sns multiplier lambda")


* The first time we sent a message, the count of the number of times the words are seen is one. This is provided by our first lambda
* The second time we sent a message, the count of the number of times the words are seen is twelve. This is a combination of our first and second lambdas working together. 
     1. The first invocation set the count to `current(0) + one`, and passed the words off to the SNS topic.  The value of each word in the database was set to **1**.
     2. After SNS recieved the message, it ran the `sns_multiplier` lambda, which added ten to the value of each word `current(1) + 10`. The value of each word in the database was set to **11**.
     2. The second invocation set the count of each word to `current(11) + 1`.  The value of each word in the database was set to 12.


## Now you're doing pubsub microservices
